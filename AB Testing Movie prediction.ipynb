The recommendations for Dick Johnson Is Dead using this recommendation system highlight strong thematic overlaps, especially with Kodachrome and Before I Fall, which share themes of death and self-reflection. However, the system lacks genre differentiation, limiting relevance. For example, Kodachrome is a drama while Dick Johnson Is Dead is a documentary, making it a less suitable recommendation. To address this, we need to refine our approach to prioritize movies within the same genre.\n",

        "4. Incorporating genres into the recommendation system improved relevance by narrowing suggestions to documentaries, aligning better with Dick Johnson Is Dead. New recommendations like Casting JonBenet and A Gray State share theme and style similarities, focusing on introspective and investigative storytelling. This genre-aware adjustment significantly enhances the system’s effectiveness compared to the original recommendations.\n",
